        <h1>Recycling Processes</h1>
        <p>At Yard, we are committed to implementing efficient and sustainable recycling processes to reduce waste and promote environmental responsibility.</p>

        <h2>Collection and Sorting</h2>
        <p>Our journey begins with the organized collection of waste materials from residents and businesses in designated city areas. Junk collectors, connected through our platform, play a vital role in this process. The collected waste is then transported to our recycling centers.</p>

        <h2>Recycling Centers</h2>
        <p>Our recycling centers serve as hubs for waste processing. Here, the collected materials are meticulously sorted into various categories, ensuring that recyclables are separated from non-recyclables. This sorting process optimizes the recycling efficiency and minimizes waste sent to landfills.</p>

        <h2>Partnerships with Factories</h2>
        <p>We have established partnerships with recycling factories to ensure that the sorted materials are efficiently processed. These factories convert recyclables into new products and materials, contributing to a circular economy and a reduction in the consumption of new resources.</p>

        <h2>Environmental Responsibility</h2>
        <p>Our recycling processes are guided by a strong commitment to environmental responsibility. We adhere to stringent environmental regulations and sustainable practices to minimize our ecological footprint and promote a greener planet.</p>
